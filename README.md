# Raugrimaldi.com Website

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## What is this?

This was a personal project to create my own website again using Angular 7 and some new Firebase features and have a demo project to show on interviews or something.     
It is hosted on Firebase on my personal account so this means I hid the environment.ts files since they have private api keys. You can still download the project and view the code but you will need some extra set up to get it to work as is. Let me know if you need help.
